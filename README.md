# JavaScript Slider

A simple slider built with vanilla JavaScript.

Things I learned while building this:

- Use instanceof to check whether passed argument is actually an Element,
- Neat little trick to remove all classes from an element,
- How to use Parcel and SCSS,
- And, finally, how to put everything together.
